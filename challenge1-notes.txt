For the optional bonus question:

The bottlenecks of this program are the Router and the DB. The router must match the incoming reqest route with the possible routes which could be more efficently done in nginx or apache. The Symfony library is implemented in PHP while nginx is implemented in C++ and can handle at lest 2x the requests per second based on benchmarks I have read. The other bottleneck, the DB, in my implementation we must wait for my progam to write/access the database before processing the next request. This could be improved by having each request have its own connection to the DB, this would mean having a new instance of the program spun up for each reqest. If request volume were so high that one database were not enough we could use a distributed key value store but this comes with its own complexities. One such complexity is consistency of the data between the database nodes/slaves. As in it would be possible that one node has data that another node which is being accessed does not have.
